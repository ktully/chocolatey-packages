VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

Glarysoft sign their installer executables with their Authenticode certificate.

To assure you that the package creator has not tampered with the installer, confirm that the output of
    Get-AuthenticodeSignature .\tools\gu5setup.exe | Format-List
includes the following
    SignerCertificate      :
        [Subject]
        CN=Glarysoft LTD, O=Glarysoft LTD, S=Beijing, C=CN

        [Issuer]
        CN=DigiCert Assured ID Code Signing CA-1, OU=www.digicert.com, O=DigiCert Inc, C=US
and also
    Status                 : Valid


The latest Glarysoft installer at time of packaging is
    url             =   https://download.glarysoft.com/gu5setup.exe
    version         =   5.163.0.189
    checksum        =   569284EBF433E6B8AE9513C9C5DCA2881003B58571748142FA55402FC1EAB100
    checksumType    =   sha256

Glarysoft do not currently provide a way of downloading old installers,
so the hash of this URL's contents will change if and when a new installer version is released.

However, even if the hash is different on later installers, you can confirm that
the SignerCertificate details on the vendor installer match those on the executable embedded in this package.
