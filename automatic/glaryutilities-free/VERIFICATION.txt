VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

Glarysoft sign their installer executables with their Authenticode certificate.

To assure you that the package creator has not tampered with the installer, confirm that the output of
    Get-AuthenticodeSignature .\tools\gu5setup.exe | Format-List
includes the following
    SignerCertificate      :
        [Subject]
        CN=Glarysoft LTD, O=Glarysoft LTD, S=Beijing, C=CN

        [Issuer]
        CN=DigiCert Assured ID Code Signing CA-1, OU=www.digicert.com, O=DigiCert Inc, C=US
and also
    Status                 : Valid


The latest Glarysoft installer at time of packaging is
    url             =   https://download.glarysoft.com/gu5setup.exe
    version         =   5.148.0.174
    checksum        =   2EE713935593B15A2BA0B01BE96DC549EC431E068890133AB3E2A8A06C4EE30E
    checksumType    =   sha256

Glarysoft do not currently provide a way of downloading old installers,
so the hash of this URL's contents will change if and when a new installer version is released.

However, even if the hash is different on later installers, you can confirm that
the SignerCertificate on the vendor installer matches that on the executable embedded in this package.
